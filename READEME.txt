instrution from the site:

In this project, you'll enhance the usability of a web page that has too much information. To make it easier to find information and read the page, you'll use progressive enhancement to add pagination.

The page includes a list of 54 students. You need to add programming to display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students.

Your solution should work for any number of student listings, whether there were 5, 25, 55 or 100 student listings.

Optionally, you can add a search bar to let users search the list of students for a particular student or students.

Feel free to use jQuery for this project, but please avoid using plugins to achieve the pagination and/or search functionality.
